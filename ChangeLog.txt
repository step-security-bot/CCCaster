  Set rollback as needed (max 15 frames) to compensate for laggy / spikey networks.
  Can adjust rollback in-game with Alt + Number.
  Training mode rollback is untested.

- Also more stable way to choose the game mode (versus/training).
  (Thanks to plumcot for the assembly code to do these two things)

v2.1b:
- Fixed startup issue on Windows XP.
- Faster disconnect when the game is closed by the other player.

v2.1a:
- Fixed spectate mode getting disconnected at the retry menu.
- Show full instructions at controller config.

v2.1:
- Can host and connect without port forward. It is still recommended to port forward if possible,
  since the initial connect will be faster, and it will probably be more stable and more likely to work.
  Note: this uses UDP hole-punching, which isn't guaranteed to work in all situations.
- In-game button config with player selection:
  Show or hide overlay with F4 on the keyboard or start button on any controller with start mapped.
  When the overlay is up, move controllers left or right to switch players.
- Change delay during netplay by pressing Ctrl + Number on the keyboard.
- Improved spectating:
  Spectating always starts from the beginning of the most recent game.
  New spectators will be redirected to spectate from existing spectators.
  These two changes should greatly reduce the extra network traffic caused by spectators.
- Linux / Wine support with some features disabled:
  No in-game button config unless someone can figure out how to hook DirectX9 under Wine.
  Can't save replays because MBAA.exe crashes when saving replays under Wine.
  Note you'll need to create a 32bit Wine prefix, see: http://askubuntu.com/a/257505
- Command line options

v2.0d:
- Fixed a bug that sometimes causes weird inputs

v2.0c:
- Optimizations
- Added a lite version:
  Disables spectators (but can still spectate)
  Can't cancel out of host or join
  Everything else still works the same
  Try this version if you get slow downs
- Enables the disabled stages (thanks to Erkz for the memory locations)

v2.0b:
- Separate spectate only option, netplay option still works same as before
- Display both player names when spectating

v2.0a:
- Fixed the freeze that happens when spectating training mode
- Offline training mode reset button enhancement
  Tap reset + left/right to go to either corner (with gap)
  Hold reset + left/right makes player 1 go into the corner
  Hold down reset to go to player 2 starting position

v2.0:
New features:
- Replay saving works now
- Brand new interface
- Spectator mode
- Broadcast offline versus mode or training mode
- Netplay training mode
- Offline training mode with delay
- Better retry menu:
  Each side chooses their own retry option independently
  Can also manually save replays first
  Only chooses once again if both sides chose once again
  Note: once you make a selection, the game waits until the other side chooses something or exits
- Notification when someone connects (can be disabled):
  Can focus the caster window, otherwise it flashes on the taskbar
  Can also play a chime sound, which can be customized
- Starts the game with high CPU priority (can be disabled)
Minor changes and bug fixes:
- Better checksums, desyncs should rarely happen now
- Can cancel a pending connection with ESC

v1.1:

- Fixed the rest of the control issues

- Fixed manually setting delay
- Increased timeout limit for non-ingame stuff, should make loading more stable

v1.0e:
- Better error messages for basic startup problems
- Clear clipboard at the end of each host session
- Fixed keyboard directions behaviour: MBAACC actually treats simultaneous left+right as left
  and up+down as down for keyboard ONLY, if this happens on a controller you just get neutral.
- Fixed AB and E macro behaviour: they should match the game exactly now. Remap if you use the AB macro

v1.0d:
- Fixed joystick controls again, remap by deleting cccaster.cfg if you have issues
- IP and port is now copied to the clipboard on host

v1.0c:
- Fixed crash on Windows XP, this may also fix the Windows 8 crash (untested).
- Increased timeout limit for the game, this should prevent crashes when loading / match over.
- Added reading from clipboard

v1.0b:
- Fixed keyboard control issues, you need to remap for it to work.
- There was a bug with version checking in v1.0a, so this version breaks compatibility.
  You should update even if you don't play on keyboard
